# belly-button-challenge

I gave up on this one after a week of searching youtube, google, and re-watching our zoom classes trying to figure out how to connect the json data to the plot. We may have covered it at some point but we do so little practice of anything before moving onto something else that nothing sticks. Turning in what I have done in hopes that I might be able to re-visit this in the future.
